# Web Browser Application

## Overview
This project is a simple web browser application developed using PyQt5 and QWebEngineView. It includes core browser features such as tabbed browsing, history management, dark mode support, and private browsing.

## Features
- **Tab Support**: Open and close multiple tabs.
- **History Management**: Save and view the history of visited sites (stores the last 100 entries).
- **Private Browsing**: Browse without saving history.
- **Dark Mode**: Support for dark mode in both the interface and web pages.
- **Toolbar**: Basic navigation tools including back, forward, refresh, home, and URL bar.
- **Persistent Cookies**: Cookies are stored persistently.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- PyQtWebEngine

## Installation
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine
   ```

2. Download or copy the project file (`browser.py`).

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python browser.py
   ```

## Usage
- **Open New Tab**: Click the `+` button on the toolbar.
- **Open Private Tab**: Click the "Private" button on the toolbar.
- **Navigate to URL**: Enter an address in the URL bar and press Enter.

- **Dark Mode**: Toggle dark mode by checking/unchecking "Dark Mode" in the menu.
- **Clear History**: Select "Clear History" from the menu to delete history records.

## Code Structure
- **BrowserTab**: Manages tab functionality. Each tab is a `QWebEngineView` instance and includes history management and private browsing features.
- **Browser**: The main application window. Manages the toolbar, tabs, and settings.
- **Dark Mode**: Applies dark mode to web pages via CSS injection and to the interface via `QStyleSheet`.
- **History**: Visited sites are saved in JSON format and stored persistently using `QSettings`.

## Notes
- The application opens Google by default.
- Private tabs do not save history and are displayed in gray.
- Dark mode affects both the interface and visited web pages.
- History is limited to the last 100 entries.
